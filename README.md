This repo contains images or scripts that grab images. These images
are then processed by [ArTTY](https://github.com/mjwhitta/artty).

99.9% of these images are not my own. I've created a handful myself.
Over the years of collecting I have lost track of where most of them
have come from. If you find your artwork here and want credit, please
let me know.
