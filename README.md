## What is this?

This repo contains images or scripts that grab images. These images
are then processed by [ArTTY](https://github.com/mjwhitta/artty) and
stored in [artty_json](https://github.com/mjwhitta/artty_json).

**Note:** The images here may be reorganized or replaced as I see fit.

## Credits for sprites

99.9% of these images are not my own. I've created a handful myself.
Over the years of collecting I have lost track of where many of them
have come from. Some came from https://www.spriters-resource.com. Most
of the Pokemon sprites are from https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net. If
you find your artwork here and want credit, please let me know. Below
is an incomplete list:

- Boo
- Dazz
- Dragonrod
- Ectevy
- Funky Fresh Fellow
- Mega_leo
- Ragengow
- Rayquane KnackXeno
- SkylaDoragono
- SmithGCN
- Stay Retro
- Supurreme
- Terrorfull_Catomizer
- Urathros
- Yawackhary
